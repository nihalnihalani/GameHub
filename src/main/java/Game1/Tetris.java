/**
 * Class that contains a Tetris Board and a Side Panel that
 * displays the game information and the controls required
 * to play.
 *
 * Has added sound effects to show the user that a certain
 * movement is made, like rotating the current Tetromino
 * or clearing one or many lines, and has added information
 * that displays the current number of lines that have been
 * cleared and the current score that the player has achieved.
 *
 *The game generates emotions with the usage of the Sounds,
 * Time, Score, and Threats challenges.
 * The game tests the player by incrementing the level depending on
 * the number of lines that it has cleared, and displays the current
 * Score that he/she has achieved, challenging his/her reaction time
 * skills. The sounds are used to indicate lines have been cleared and
 * indicate a reward for the user, giving motivation. The threats on this
 * game are represented by the uncertainties of placing a Tetromino on
 * a certain spot and how this choice can affect further into the game.
